2. If you don't already have Node.js on your computer, install it from: [Download link](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
3. In terminal, navigate to the new repository and run the command:

```

# How To Run Experiments

Follow the next step to create a local HTTPS server. **You must complete installation to perform these steps.**

1. In terminal, navigate to the folder you have been coding in (default name gazerTemplate) and run the following command:

```
npm run experiment
```

**The server you have opened will close if you exit the tab in which you ran the previous command. You will have to repeat step 1 each time you want to run the experiment.**

2. In the browser, navigate to this URL:
   [Localhost](http://localhost:8000/)
3. Once you've done that, you'll be at the experiment.html file and at the start of the program :)
