## Data

The data generated by Webgazer is a time series of x and y coordinates for predicted gaze position on the screen in pixels.
  
### Sample Output

Sample output for part of trial using Gazer: 

| time         | x         | y |
|:-------------|:------------------|:------|
| 418           | 766 | 341  |
| 497 | 772   | 326  |
| 574           | 731      | 351   |
| 656           | 939 | 329  |

The output of all trials using Gazer plugins include data in the above format as an array of hash tables. Each element in the array is one of the Gazer points (in chronological order) including values for time, x-coord, and y-coord. For example, a Single-Dot-Duration trial lasting 2000ms will generate an array with approximately 35 points. 

### Analysis

Code is currently being developed for release that will allow easy analysis of Gazer data for fixations and saccades. The analysis will be written in Python.

### Sample Analysis

Data from 42 participants participating in multiple blocks of the exogeneous fixation task generates the following data:

A pattern of fixation on the central cross then a saccade and subsequent fixation to the new stimulus after its onset at 500ms is clearly visible.
