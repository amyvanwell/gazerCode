## How to Start

### Downloading
  
Full instructions for downloading the Gazer system including a demo experiment can be found on the Github repo [here](https://github.com/amyvanwell/gazerCode).

### Editing
  
After downloading and install the system, make sure you follow the instructions in the repo's README for how to build and save edits to the src tree. To actually edit your experiment, make changes in the experiment.js file of the src tree. Consult the jsPsych [website](https://www.jspsych.org/) for how to use the framework. 

### Making new plugins
  
There may be the case that you have a designed an experiment with trials that does not correspond to any of the existing plug-ins. I reccommend using the plug-in Single-Image-Duration as a beginning point to edit and develop a new plug-in as it has the least amount of code. If the trial you want to have is sufficiently sophisticated, you may contact the original author Amy vanWell (amyvanwell@uvic.ca) and request either assistance or for the author to write the plug-in.
